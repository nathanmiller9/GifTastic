## App Description 
#### The GifTastic app calls on the GIPHY API to display gifs when the user clicks on buttons that are either pre-provided or created by the user using the input field and submit button.  Upon clicking a button, ten still image gifs related to the button will display with their ratings listed below.  Once the gifs display, the user is then able to click each gif to trigger its animation.  If they click the gif again, the gif will pause.  Clicking a different button will display ten new gifs and so on. 

## App Explanation
#### Used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates gifs of the user's choice.  Called the GIPHY API and used JavaScript and jQuery to alter the HTML.  Created buttons that will grab ten static, non-animated gif images from GIPHY and place them on the page.  When the user clicks one of these images, the gif will animate.  If the user clicks the image again, the gif will stop animation.  Under every gif, its rating will be displayed.  The page also contains a form that takes the value from a user input box and adds it to a topics array.  A function will then call takes each topic in the array and remake the array into buttons on the page.
