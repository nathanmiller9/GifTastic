- Description 
The GifTastic app calls on the GIPHY API to display gifs when the user clicks on buttons that are either pre-provided or created by the user using the input field and submit button.  Upon clicking a button, ten still image gifs related to the button will display with their ratings listed below.  Once the gifs display, the user is then able to click each gif to trigger its animation.  If they click the gif again, the gif will pause.  Clicking a different button will display ten new gifs and so on. 


- Requirements

Use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates gifs of your choice.  Call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to alter the HTML of your site.  Create buttons that will grap 10 static, non-animated gif images from GIPHY and place them on the page.  When the user clicks one of these images, the gif should animate.  If the user clicks the image again, the gif should stop animating.  Under every gif, display its rating.  Add a form to your page that takes the value from a user input box and adds it to your topics array.  Then make a function call that takes each topic in the array and remakes the buttons on the page.
